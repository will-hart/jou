## LD46 (By the sword)

> Theme: "Keep it alive"

## Initial thoughts

A coop 1-(4?) player card game. Ideally playable by single player. Difficulty scales.

> Later note: not sure this is possible with the chosen theme? Would need an AI
> player to fill the role of other fighters

Rather than attacking something, need to help build something / prevent it from
breaking.

I want some of these mechanisms:

- engine building / deck building - players slowly build up their hand as a
  means of "levelling up"
- good vs evil track - players have a good/evil score based on their drafted
  hand. This gives them improved abilities but if there is insufficient balance
  in the player group can cause things to go wrong
- betrayal-cooperative - common goal vs personal goal
- game end: Everybody loses if the "thing" gets broken, but there is only one
  winner based on score.

## Theme Ideas

> THOUGHT: The perfect theme would give players both a reason to work towards the common
> goal and a reason to betray their friends

- **gladiators - must stay alive to keep the spectacle going and get the
  spectators excited (otherwise the emperor will execute everybody) but at the
  same time don't want to lose**
- ~~virus~~ (had to say it but nope thanks)
- nature - protect the sacred tree which prevents the "rift" from opening, but
  also try to increase your personal power (swords and sorcery, probably the
  most entertaining but done to death)
- protect a building/community against a natural disaster - what is the
  motivation for betrayal? (modern / ancient but "realistic". Not very happy!)
- a party - keep the party going vs increasing your own popularity + bringing
  people to your own party (party hard, the card game?)
- factory - producing some goods vs stealing resources to improve your own
  factories (keep it producing by supplying raw materials)
- war logistics - supply the front but don't let the other companies become
  dominant (haven't seen anything too much like this, fairly dry topic)
- protect a dungeon vs adventurers (done 1000 times)
- some sort of sport game? Would probably stretch the interpretation of the
  theme :)

> Of these I think I like the gladiator theme the best. Its not entirely new but
> at the same time its less overdone than the nature/sorcery one. Gives lots of
> opportunities to save your own skin while keeping the spectacle going.

## Rules

- **the purpose of the game is to survive an epic fight in the arena**.
  - Players must survive long enough to increase the excitement of the crowd
    sufficiently so that their lives are spared.
  - Excitement is increased by defeating creatures or inflicting damage on other
    players.
  - Players have their own excitement level, and there is also an arena
    excitement level.
  - players and the arena start with 10 excitement
  - players can spend their excitement to upgrade their hand
- **victory conditions** are either:
  - if a player gets to 0 excitement they are eliminated
  - if the arena gets to 0 excitement all the players lose
  - if all players are eliminated before the arena gets to 20 excitement, they all lose
  - the arena excitement gets to 20 (all players win)
  - one player gets to 12 and is the last fighter remaining (the remaining player wins)
- there are three types of cards - fighters, creatures, moves
  - **fighters** are always visible to other players. They include people like
    "net man" "slave" "swordsman" etc that the player can choose to have in his
    squad.
    - Players are limited to three fighters, to get a new fighter once they have
      three they must allow a fighter to be killed then "purchase" a replacement
      using excitement points
  - **creatures** are kept in a player's hand and are hidden until played. They
    include things that the players can fight, including enemy chariots, wild
    beasts etc.
    - only one creatures can be on the board at the same time
  - **moves** are things (good or bad) that the fighters can do in their turn to
    defeat the creatures, cause the creatures to act a certain way (for instance
    to deflect them onto another player to save their own skin) or to raise the
    excitement level of the crowd
- **setup** basic premise is that players start with just 1-4 players in the ring
  - each player takes a level 1 fighter card of their choice
  - five randomly drawn fighter cards are then placed in the table face up (they
    can be drafted at a later stage)
  - players draw three random cards from the creatures and moves deck as their
    starting hand.
- **play a turn**
  - each turn the player with the highest excitement goes first, and play goes clockwise
    - if there is a tie then who knows, random?
  - players can chose to do exactly one of the following actions:
    1. play any number of creature cards from their hand and up to one move card
    2. play one move card against another player
    3. spend excitement to purchase a new warrior (one excitement per warrior level)
    4. spend excitement to increase their hand size
    5. pass
    6. **Q: Is there an arena map?** --> move around the arena **I think this will be a bit too much**
- **combat vs creatures**
  - combat cards are placed by players throughout a turn, however the effects
    (if any) are only applied at the end of the turn
  - if in a single turn players can play sufficient moves to defeat a creature,
    then it is removed and each player that contributes gets a share of the
    monster's excitement
  - if at the end of any given turn there is not enough combat power to kill a
    monster then the attack cards are removed and the creature fights back /
    carries out its effect
- **combat vs players**
  - players can attack other players.
  - the effect of attacks vs players applies immediately
  - instead of defeating enemies, the combat power reduces the excitement of the
    targeted player by that amount
- **clean up**
  - players may discard up to one card from their hand
  - players then draw back up to their current hand size
