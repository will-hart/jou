# By the Sword

A card game made in 48 / 72 hours for Ludum Dare 46

> **Theme**: "Keep it alive"

In *By The Sword* players work together to please the Emperor Caligula
by carrying out exciting actions in the arenas of Ancient Rome. Players
must defeat opponents by carefully selecting actions that excite the
crowd, and must hope to gain enough fame so that the Emperor will spare
their lives when tehy are finally defeated. But watch out, unless one
player takes all the glory for themself!

By The Sword is a card game made for Ludum Dare 46 using the Jou framework,
based on [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io).

## Repo structure

The design docs and card designs are in the `/docs` folder. Cards were made
using Excel, Inkscape, a little bit of Krita and NanDeck. The source code for
the game mode is available from `index.ts`. 

The repo is built using yarn workspaces.
